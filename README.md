# Easy-To-do
The Easy To-do Chrome extension started off with a simple inquiry that I made into ChatGPT. Then I kind of developed the idea and will be adding more features and functionalities in the coming days.

**Features**
- Add task with priority levels (Low, Medium, High)
- Mark task as completed
- Delete task
- Persist tasks using local storage
- Intuitive user interface

  
**Installation**

Clone the repository or download the source code.
Open your browser's extension management page.
Enable developer mode.
Load the extension by selecting the "Load unpacked" option and choosing the project directory.

**Usage**

Click on the extension icon in your browser's toolbar to open the popup.
Enter a task or to-do in the input field.
Select a priority level from the dropdown.
Click the "Add" button to add the task.
Your task will be displayed in the list with the priority indicator.
To mark a task as completed, click the checkbox next to the reminder text.
To delete a task, click the delete button (trash icon).
Your tasks will be saved and persisted using local storage.
